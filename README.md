# Object-exercises
This repository contains my learning process with regard to Objects. As you'll notice, I begin by first understanding the fundamental operations involved with objects and as the exercises continue, I introduce new concepts involving arrays and Maps and their methods.
The Objecive here is to record my learning process for future references and possibly for inspiration. The repository is constantly updated and it is strictly an operation based repository.
